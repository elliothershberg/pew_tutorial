## R Markdown

The [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org) is a nonpartisan fact tank headquarted in Washington, D.C. Since the centers inception in 2004, it has conducted high quality research in several areas. The P.R.C. currently focuses on nine areas:

* U.S. Politics & Policy
* Journalism & Media
* Internet & Technology
* Science & Society
* Religion & Public Life
* Hispanic Trends
* Global Attitudes & Trends
* Social & Demographic Trends
* Research Methodology

That is a wide range of topics! The P.R.C releases high quality datasets pertaining to all nine areas of research. Data scientists rejoice!

In this tutorial, we will cover how to:

1. Set up a Pew account, in order to download datasets
2. Use the **pewdata** R package to read Pew data directly into R
3. Perform exploratory data analysis using tidy tools
4. Conduct a tidy hypothesis test using the **infer** package

Let's get started!

1. Setting up a Pew Account

In order to download raw datasets from Pew, it is necessary to sign up for a Pew account. Thankfully, this is fairly straightforward to do. To do so, navigate to [http://www.pewinternet.org/datasets](http://www.pewinternet.org/datasets). You will see the following page for new users:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
